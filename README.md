  ## <h2><br/>How I worked.:point_down:
* Setup all dependencies in project first.
* Used MVVM architecture so made all packages.
* And through newsApi got data on Model Class by Retrofit.
* Fetch it in repository.
* Then from repository got data in ViewModel and then to Fragments.
* Used navigation components for navigating from one fragment to another.
* Instance of room database is made where all the data will be saved offline in the database.
* So that we can fetch it when no internet is there.
* Used PopUp Menu for options of sorting data.
* Then implemented all the sorting by calling there particular api.
* Then in last done some UI tweaks and resolve some errors. 
  
  ## <h2><br/>Problem Faced:construction::construction:
- [ ] Content of detail news by API is not sufficient.
- [ ] Some data is not there so used default things.
